# Audio Signal Processing

This repository covers basic signal processing techniques applied to audio signals. It includes several projects that explore the fundamentals of signal processing, such as FFT, FIR/IIR filtering, and noise cancellation.

## Projects
- **Audio Visualizer**: Real-time audio visualization using FFT.
- **Noise Canceller**: Apply FIR filters to reduce background noise.
- **Pitch Shifter**: Modify the pitch of an audio signal.
- **Beat Detection**: Detect beats in music using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
